### 

This utility is engineered to assist systems with limited capabilities, ensuring smooth and stable operation. It is fully compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and performs reliably even on older hardware with modest specifications. The application itself requires approximately 100MB of storage space, a minimal investment for the significant amount of unused data it can help you reclaim. Memory usage is also efficient; 2GB of RAM is sufficient, though having 4GB or more is recommended for optimal performance when multitasking with other applications. Support is provided for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

The software operates independently of a dedicated graphics card and has no unusual dependencies. Its core function is to streamline system processes and recover valuable resources, making it particularly beneficial for older machines that may struggle with modern software demands.

Let’s summarize all the requirements:

*   Minimum hard disk space – 100 Mb
*   RAM – at least 2GB
*   OS – Windows 7 or later (x32 and x64 supported) / MacOS 11 Big Sur or never
*   GPU – no requirements
